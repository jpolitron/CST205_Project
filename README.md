# Spectator Assist

Description: Spec Assist is built for friends and family of race runners. Namely marathon and other long-distance events. Most people aren’t able to follow runners throughout a marathon and usually only stay in one place. This application allows for spectators to constantly track a runner’s location and therefore see how close one is to finishing or to running by. It works by drawing information from a predetermined race course, determined by an event member most likely, and applying it to a map on the website. This is simply for better visibility and clarity as to the race in question. It then tracks the user via runner ID with tracking enabled and returns their coordinates on the map.
